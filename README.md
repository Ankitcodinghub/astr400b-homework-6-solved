In this assignment you will store the separation and relative velocities of the center of mass of the simulated MW, M33 and M31 over the entire simulation and plot the corre- sponding orbits.

Please use files located in the directory /home/astr400b/VLowRes on nimoy. They are smaller files and will be easier to handle. If you are using nimoy, create a symbolic link to this directory rather than copying the files over to your own directory.

If you want to use the files on your own computer there is a tar.gz file for each galaxy in that directory. You can download the file using sftp. Note this might take a bit of time.

sftp username@nimoy.as.arizona.edu get *.tar.gz

and then untar the files using the below in the command line:

tar -xvzf filename.tar.gz

You will need to import ReadFile.py and CenterOfMass.py (along with numpy, astropy,

matplotlib).

If you run into errors or not sure what part of the code is not working following your design, print function is always your friend. Try to print the variables out to see if the content is what you want.

We have provided a template file to help with the assignment.

1 Modify existing Code

A modification to CenterOfMass.py: in Homework4 we decreased RMAX by 2 to refine the volume. Create a new version of CenterOfMass.py, where you modify COM P so that it now takes an input volDec that defines the amount by which RMAX is decreased. Replace ‚ÄúRMAX/2‚Äù with ‚ÄúRMAX/volDec‚Äù everywhere it appears.

2 Looping over all Files

Create a function called OrbitCOM that takes the following as input: ‚Ä¢ galaxy the name of the galaxy, e.g. ‚ÄúMW‚Äù

‚Ä¢ start the number of the first snapshot to be read in.

‚Ä¢ end the number of the last snapshot to be read in.

‚Ä¢ n an integer indicating the intervals over which you will return the COM.

For this assignment you will compute the orbits up to Snapshot 800 (‚àº12 Gyr). BUT

we will output values in intervals of n=5.

This function will compute the time and COM position and velocity vectors of a given galaxy in each snapshot and save that output into a file (we don‚Äôt want to run this code repeatedly).

<ol>
<li>Define a string for the filename for the file that will store the orbit: fileout = ‚ÄúOr- bit galaxyname.txt‚Äù.</li>
<li>Set delta and volDec to be used with a CenterOfMass object. Use delta = 0.1 and volDec = 2. For M33, volDec needs to be larger because it will be severely tidally stripped towards the end of the simulation. volDec=4 is a good choice for M33.</li>
<li>Define an array snap ids that stores the snapshot id sequence using np.arange (from start to end). Bonus: check if the input is eligible ‚Äì make the code stop if the array is empty.</li>
<li>Define an array called orbit using np.zeros with the same number of rows as snap id and 7 columns (usage: np.zeros([number of rows, number of columns])). This array will store the time, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz of the COM of the galaxy at each snapshot.</li>
<li>Set up a for loop to compute the COM position and velocities at each snapshot of the simulation. For the convenience of generating the filenames, use the following:
for i, snap id in enumerate(snap ids):

In this way, if start is set to 0, end is 800, and n is 5, then i will be 0, 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶, 160,

and snap id will be 0, 5, 10, 15, ‚Ä¶, 800. Now do the following in the loop:

<ul>
<li>Define the filename for the galaxy you are going to read in. See instructions in
Homework 5 (ilbl = ‚Äò000‚Äô + str(snap id), etc).
</li>
<li>Create a CenterOfMass object using disk particles.</li>
<li>Use the COM P and COM V functions in your CenterOfMass object to store the position and velocity of the center of mass (just as you did in Homework 4).</li>
<li>In the first column of Orbit, store the time in Gyr (divide by 1000). 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

Use your code to compute the time and center of mass position and velocity vectors (3D coordinates) for each galaxy (MW, M31, M33) from SnapNumber 0 to SnapNumber 800 in intervals of n=5, generating three files storing the COM properties over time. Note: SnapNumber 0= 0 Gyr and Snap 800 = ‚àº12 Gyr in the future. Depending on your research project you might need to re-run this code with a smaller n later.

Read in the COM data files you just created for each galaxy. Note the file has a header that starts with #, which yields the column headings.

Create a function that computes the difference between two vectors and returns the magnitude of that vector. Use this function to compute the magnitude of the relative separation and velocity of : 1) MW and M31; and 2) M33 and M31.

Plot the magnitude of the separation between: 1) MW and M31 and 2) M33 and M31 as a function of time. To do this, you will need to subtract the X,Y,Z positions of the MW from those of the M31. The same for M33 and M31.

Plot the magnitude of the relative velocity between: 1) MW and M31 and 2) M33 and M31 as a function of time. Recall that again you need to subtract each component of the velocity vectors. An example is shown in Figure 1.

<ul>
<li>‚Äì &nbsp;Recall that in CenterOfMass, you initialize the class with a member variable called self.time. This means it is a property of the instance of the class. So if you called COM= CenterOfMass(‚Ä¶) etc, then you can use COM.time to retrieve the time of the snapshot.</li>
<li>‚Äì &nbsp;The row index of the Orbit array (that we use to save the time) is given by i</li>
<li>‚Äì &nbsp;NOTE: Since time, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz have different units, it would be quite complicated to store them with units in one numpy array. Instead, we will just store their values. For any variable with astropy units, you can obtain their pure values by var.value. For example, if the variable x = 10 kpc, then x.value will be 10.
‚Ä¢ Store the COM Position and Velocity in the Orbit array. Remember to use var.value to only store their pure values.

‚Ä¢ print the counter of the for loop to the screen so you know where the code is at.

6. Save the array Orbit to a file: np.savetxt(fileout, orbit, fmt = ‚Äù%11.3f‚Äù*7, com- ments=‚Äô#‚Äô, header=‚Äù{: 10s}{: 11s}{: 11s}{: 11s}{: 11s}{: 11s}{: 11s}‚Äù .format(‚Äôt‚Äô, ‚Äôx‚Äô, ‚Äôy‚Äô, ‚Äôz‚Äô, ‚Äôvx‚Äô, ‚Äôvy‚Äô, ‚Äôvz‚Äô))

To test your code, start with a small range of snapshots. Plotting
